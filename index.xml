      <description>Digital Minimalism is an idea proposed by Cal Newport in a book with the same name. Its premise is that our lives have been improved only marginally by our modern-day digital tools. It is time to step back and critically evaluate what technology we use and why. Based on this inventory, we should intentionally incorporate only those technologies in a way that enhances our lives while discarding others.
I was inspired by this book as a software engineer to build my own philosophy for creating technology.</description>
